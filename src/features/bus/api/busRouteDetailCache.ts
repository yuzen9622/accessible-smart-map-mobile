 * Two callers want the same payload at almost the same moment: selecting a
 * route prefetches every BUS leg's stop ETAs, and expanding one of those legs
 * then polls it. Without a shared cache the expand would refetch from scratch
 * and render placeholder rows again — the very flash this cache exists to kill.
 *
 * `peekRouteDetail` is the synchronous half: a hook can seed its initial state
 * from an already-warm entry so the first render after expanding is real data,
 * not a loading state.
